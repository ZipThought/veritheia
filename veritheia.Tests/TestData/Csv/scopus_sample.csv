Here, AI-based chatbot systems can act as automated conversational agents, capable of promoting health, providing education, and potentially prompting behaviour change. Exploring the motivation to use health chatbots is required to predict uptake; however, few studies to date have explored their acceptability. This research aimed to explore participants' willingness to engage with AI-led health chatbots. Methods: The study incorporated semi-structured interviews (N-29) which informed the development of an online survey (N-216) advertised via social media. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. A survey of 24 items explored demographic and attitudinal variables, including acceptability and perceived utility. The quantitative data were analysed using binary regressions with a single categorical predictor. Results: Three broad themes: 'Understanding of chatbots', 'AI hesitancy' and 'Motivations for health chatbots' were identified, outlining concerns about accuracy, cyber-security, and the inability of AI-led services to empathise. The survey showed moderate acceptability (67%), correlated negatively with perceived poorer IT skills OR = 0.32 [CI95%:0.13–0.78] and dislike for talking to computers OR = 0.77 [CI95%:0.60–0.99] as well as positively correlated with perceived utility OR = 5.10 [CI95%:3.08–8.43], positive attitude OR = 2.71 [CI95%:1.77–4.16] and perceived trustworthiness OR = 1.92 [CI95%:1.13–3.25]. Conclusion: Most internet users would be receptive to using health chatbots, although hesitancy regarding this technology is likely to compromise engagement. Intervention designers focusing on AI-led health chatbots need to employ user-centred and theory-based approaches addressing patients' concerns and optimising user experience in order to achieve the best uptake and utilisation. Patients' perspectives, motivation and capabilities need to be taken into account when developing and assessing the effectiveness of health chatbots. © The Author(s) 2019.","Acceptability; AI; Artificial Intelligence; bot; chatbot","adult; article; artificial intelligence; comparative effectiveness; computer security; genetic transcription; human; Internet; motivation; quantitative analysis; semi structured interview; skill; social media","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071722067"

The eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important to interpret the machine learning models to enhance trust management by allowing human experts to understand the underlying data evidence and causal reasoning. According to IDS, the critical role of trust management is to understand the impact of the malicious data to detect any intrusion in the system. The previous studies focused more on the accuracy of the various classification algorithms for trust in IDS. They do not often provide insights into their behavior and reasoning provided by the sophisticated algorithm. Therefore, in this paper, we have addressed XAI concept to enhance trust management by exploring the decision tree model in the area of IDS. We use simple decision tree algorithms that can be easily read and even resemble a human approach to decision-making by splitting the choice into many small subchoices for IDS. We experimented with this approach by extracting rules in a widely used KDD benchmark dataset. We also compared the accuracy of the decision tree approach with the other state-of-the-art algorithms.  © 2021 Basim Mahbooba et al.","","Computer crime; Decision trees; Information management; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Network security; Benchmark datasets; Classification algorithm; Decision tree modeling; Decision-tree algorithm; Intrusion Detection Systems; Machine learning models; State-of-the-art algorithms; Trust management; Decision making","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101002146"

Currently there exist two common approaches to malware detection without domain knowledge, namely byte n-grams and strings. In this work we explore the feasibility of applying neural networks to malware detection and feature learning. We do this by restricting ourselves to a minimal amount of domain knowledge in order to extract a portion of the Portable Executable (PE) header. By doing this we show that neural networks can learn from raw bytes without explicit feature construction, and perform even better than a domain knowledge approach that parses the PE header into explicit features. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Cyber security; Deep learning; Malware detection","Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Deep learning; Cyber security; Domain knowledge; Feature construction; Feature learning; Malware detection; N-grams; Portable executable; Malware","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85037331491"

However, the technologies and architectures needed to connect and extend physical factory operations to the cyber world have not been fully resolved. Although cloud computing and service-oriented architectures demonstrate strong adoption, such implementations are commonly produced using information technology perspectives, which can overlook engineering, control and Industry 4.0 design concerns relating to real-time performance, reliability or resilience. Hence, this research compares the latency and reliability performance of cyber-physical interfaces implemented using traditional cloud computing (i.e. centralised), and emerging fog computing (i.e. decentralised) paradigms, to deliver real-time embedded machine learning engineering applications for Industry 4.0. The findings highlight that despite the cloud's highly scalable processing capacity, the fog's decentralised, localised and autonomous topology may provide greater consistency, reliability, privacy and security for Industry 4.0 engineering applications, with the difference in observed maximum latency ranging from 67.7%–99.4%. In addition, communication failures rates highlighted differences in both consistency and reliability, with the fog interface successfully responding to 900,000 communication requests (i.e. 0% failure rate), and the cloud interface recording failure rates of 0.11%, 1.42%, and 6.6% under varying levels of stress. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cyber-physical systems; Embedded analytics; Emerging architectures; Engineering informatics; Industrial analytics; Industry 4.0; Machine learning","Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Failure analysis; Fog; Fog computing; Industry 4.0; Information services; Learning systems; Legacy systems; Machine learning; Safety engineering; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Embedded analytics; Emerging architectures; Emerging technologies; Engineering applications; Engineering informatics; Industrial analytics; Processing capacities; Reliability performance; Engineering education","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065718296"

Indeed, the emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), commonly referred to as Industry 4.0, promises to revolutionize production and manufacturing through the use of large numbers of networked embedded sensing devices, and the combination of emerging computing technologies, such as Fog/Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence. The IIoT is characterized by an increased degree of inter-connectivity, which not only creates opportunities for the industries that adopt it, but also for cyber-criminals. Indeed, IoT security currently represents one of the major obstacles that prevent the widespread adoption of IIoT technology. Unsurprisingly, such concerns led to an exponential growth of published research over the last few years. To get an overview of the field, we deem it important to systematically survey the academic literature so far, and distill from it various security requirements as well as their popularity. This paper consists of two contributions: our primary contribution is a systematic review of the literature over the period 2011-2019 on IIoT Security, focusing in particular on the security requirements of the IIoT. Our secondary contribution is a reflection on how the relatively new paradigm of Fog computing can be leveraged to address these requirements, and thus improve the security of the IIoT. © 1998-2012 IEEE.","cyber-security; fog computing; Industrial Internet of Things; security requirements","Artificial intelligence; Cryptography; Fog; Fog computing; Manufacture; Surveys; Academic literature; Emerging computing technologies; Exponential growth; Industrial context; Internet of thing (IOT); Primary contribution; Security requirements; Systematic Review; Industrial internet of things (IIoT)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091841797"
