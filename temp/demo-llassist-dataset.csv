"Large Language Models for Cybersecurity Threat Detection and Analysis","This paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs) in detecting and analyzing cybersecurity threats through natural language processing techniques. We present a comprehensive framework that leverages the contextual understanding capabilities of transformer-based models to identify potential security threats in unstructured text data from various sources including security logs, threat intelligence reports, and social media. Our experimental evaluation on a dataset of 50,000 security-related documents shows that our approach achieves 94.2% accuracy in threat detection, significantly outperforming traditional keyword-based methods. The model demonstrates particular strength in identifying zero-day threats and advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns through linguistic pattern recognition. We also discuss the implications of using LLMs for real-time threat monitoring and the potential security concerns related to model deployment in sensitive environments.","Smith, John A.; Doe, Alice B.; Johnson, Michael C.","2024","IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","10.1109/TIFS.2024.001","https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2024.001","large language models;cybersecurity;threat detection;natural language processing;transformer models"
"Machine Learning Applications in Network Intrusion Detection Systems","Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) have evolved significantly with the integration of machine learning techniques. This comprehensive survey examines the application of various ML algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, and deep neural networks in detecting network anomalies and intrusions. We analyze 127 research papers published between 2018-2023 to identify trends, challenges, and future directions in ML-based NIDS. Our analysis reveals that ensemble methods combining multiple algorithms achieve the highest detection rates (96.8% average) while maintaining low false positive rates. Deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks, show promise for detecting sophisticated attacks but require substantial computational resources. The paper also discusses the challenges of adversarial attacks against ML-based NIDS and proposes defense strategies. We conclude with recommendations for practitioners and identify gaps that warrant further research.","Brown, Karen L.; Wilson, Robert S.; Martinez, Elena P.","2023","ACM Computing Surveys","10.1145/CS.2023.002","https://doi.org/10.1145/CS.2023.002","machine learning;intrusion detection;network security;anomaly detection;deep learning"
"AI-Driven Threat Intelligence Analysis: A Natural Language Understanding Approach","Threat intelligence analysis has become increasingly complex as cyber threats evolve and multiply. This work presents TITAN (Threat Intelligence Text Analysis Network), a novel AI-driven system that employs natural language understanding to automatically process and analyze threat intelligence reports. TITAN combines named entity recognition, relation extraction, and sentiment analysis to extract actionable insights from unstructured threat intelligence data.

"Contextual AI for Insider Threat Detection: A Behavioral Analysis Framework","Insider threats pose significant risks to organizational security, often going undetected by traditional perimeter-based security measures. This paper introduces CONTEXT-AI, a behavioral analysis framework that leverages contextual artificial intelligence to detect potential insider threats through multi-modal data analysis. The framework combines user activity monitoring, communication pattern analysis, and psychological profiling using advanced machine learning techniques. Our approach employs graph neural networks to model user relationships and behavior patterns, while utilizing natural language processing to analyze email communications and document access patterns. CONTEXT-AI was evaluated in a controlled environment with 10,000 employees over 18 months, successfully detecting 94% of simulated insider threat scenarios with a false positive rate of 2.1%. The system identified subtle behavioral changes that preceded malicious activities by an average of 23 days, providing ample time for intervention. We discuss the ethical implications of insider threat monitoring and propose privacy-preserving techniques to protect employee rights while maintaining security effectiveness.","White, Jennifer L.; Black, David M.; Green, Amanda S.","2023","IEEE Security & Privacy","10.1109/MSEC.2023.006","https://doi.org/10.1109/MSEC.2023.006","insider threat;behavioral analysis;contextual AI;privacy preservation;graph neural networks"

"Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Cybersecurity Defense Strategies","Traditional cybersecurity defense mechanisms often rely on static rules and signatures that struggle to adapt to evolving threats. This paper presents an innovative approach using reinforcement learning (RL) to develop adaptive cybersecurity defense strategies that can learn from attack patterns and adjust defenses in real-time. Our ADAPDEF (Adaptive Defense Framework) employs multi-agent reinforcement learning where different agents specialize in various aspects of network security including firewall configuration, intrusion detection, and incident response. The system uses a custom reward function that balances security effectiveness with operational efficiency. We evaluate ADAPDEF in a simulated enterprise network environment against various attack scenarios including DDoS attacks, advanced persistent threats, and zero-day exploits. Results show that our adaptive approach reduces successful attack rates by 67% compared to static defense mechanisms while maintaining network performance. The system demonstrates continuous learning capabilities, improving its defense strategies over time as it encounters new attack patterns. We discuss the challenges of deploying RL-based security systems in production environments and propose solutions for ensuring stability and explainability.","Newman, Patricia K.; Foster, Gregory L.; Wright, Stephanie C.","2023","Computer Networks","10.1016/j.comnet.2023.008","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2023.008","reinforcement learning;adaptive security;multi-agent systems;cybersecurity;network defense"
"Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Cybersecurity Intelligence Sharing","Information sharing is crucial for effective cybersecurity defense, but privacy concerns and competitive considerations often limit collaboration between organizations. This research proposes a federated learning approach for privacy-preserving cybersecurity intelligence sharing that enables organizations to collectively improve their security posture without exposing sensitive data. Our FEDCYBER framework allows multiple organizations to collaboratively train machine learning models for threat detection while keeping their data locally stored and protected. The system employs differential privacy techniques and secure aggregation protocols to ensure that individual organization data cannot be reverse-engineered from the shared model. We conducted experiments with 25 organizations across different sectors, demonstrating that the federated approach achieves 94.7% of the accuracy obtained by centralized learning while preserving data privacy. The shared model shows improved performance in detecting new and emerging threats compared to individual organization models. We analyze the trade-offs between privacy protection and model accuracy, and discuss practical considerations for implementing federated learning in cybersecurity contexts including trust establishment, incentive mechanisms, and regulatory compliance.","Cooper, Alexander J.; Mitchell, Rebecca L.; Turner, Daniel S.","2024","IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","10.1109/TDSC.2024.009","https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2024.009","federated learning;privacy preservation;cybersecurity;intelligence sharing;differential privacy"
"Explainable AI for Cybersecurity: Enhancing Trust in Automated Defense Systems","The adoption of AI-based cybersecurity systems is often hindered by their black-box nature, making it difficult for security analysts to understand and trust automated decisions. This paper addresses the explainability challenge in cybersecurity AI through the development of EXPLAIN-SEC, a comprehensive framework for generating human-interpretable explanations for security-related AI decisions. Our approach combines multiple explanation techniques including LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), and custom domain-specific visualization methods. EXPLAIN-SEC provides different explanation granularities ranging from high-level decision summaries to detailed feature attributions, catering to various stakeholder needs including executives, security analysts, and system administrators. We evaluate the framework through user studies with 120 cybersecurity professionals, measuring comprehension, trust, and decision-making effectiveness. Results indicate that our explanations increase user trust in AI decisions by 73% and improve incident response accuracy by 28%. The paper also discusses the challenges of generating explanations for time-sensitive security decisions and proposes solutions for real-time explainability. We conclude with recommendations for incorporating explainability requirements into cybersecurity AI system design.","Baker, Christine M.; Phillips, Robert A.; Evans, Helen J.","2024","ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology","10.1145/TIST.2024.010","https://doi.org/10.1145/TIST.2024.010","explainable AI;cybersecurity;trust;interpretability;automated defense"
