# Veritheia

*From Veritas (Latin: truth) and alētheia (Greek: truth as "uncoveredness")*

### I. What It Is

Veritheia is epistemic infrastructure—a place to think, reflect, remember, and author knowledge.

You bring your own source material—books, PDFs, journal entries, recordings—and through Veritheia you compose your own synthesis, develop your own insights, and build structured knowledge that is yours in substance and form.

It is public infrastructure for those engaged in real intellectual work: educators designing curricula, students seeking insight rather than answers, researchers mapping complex domains, and civic leaders cultivating understanding across communities.

### II. Architectural Imperatives

The environment is defined by its architecture.

Its perimeter is sovereign. Its reasoning is grounded. Its structure is open.

### III. The Purpose

The purpose of this architecture is to ensure that your intellectual work remains yours.

Through disciplined inquiry, you develop your own understanding. Through structured engagement, you author your own insights. Through formative practice, you become more capable—not more dependent.

### IV. Documentation

Comprehensive project documentation is available in the [docs](docs/) directory:

### V. Quick Start

```bash
# Build the solution
dotnet build

# Run with .NET Aspire
dotnet run --project veritheia.AppHost
```

### VI. Current Status

See [Development Progress](development/PROGRESS.md) for detailed phase implementation status.

### VII. Technical Requirements

- .NET 9 SDK (for native UUIDv7 support)
- Docker Desktop (for PostgreSQL container)
- .NET Aspire workload

### VIII. Provenance

The architecture and its methodologies are derived from the following research.
