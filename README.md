# Veritheia

### I. What It Is

Veritheia is an environment for inquiry.

You provide the sources—the curriculum, the library, the research—and Veritheia integrates them into a single, coherent body of knowledge.

It is designed for educational institutions, research groups, and individuals.

### II. Architectural Imperatives

The environment is defined by its architecture.

Its perimeter is sovereign. Its reasoning is grounded. Its structure is open.

### III. The Purpose

The purpose of this architecture is to provide a foundation for disciplined thought.

Its use is a formative practice.

### IV. Provenance

The architecture and its methodologies are derived from the following research.
