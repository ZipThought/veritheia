This paper introduces LLAssist, an open-source tool designed to streamline literature reviews by leveraging Large Language Models and NLP techniques. The methodologies for systematic screening and constrained composition in Veritheia are directly derived from the patterns established in LLAssist.

### 2. EdgePrompt: Engineering Guardrail Techniques for Offline LLMs in K-12 Educational Settings
**File**: [`3701716.3717810.pdf`](./3701716.3717810.pdf)  
**Authors**: Riza Alaudin Syah, Christoforus Yoga Haryanto, Emily Lomempow, Krishna Malik, Irvan Putra  
**Year**: 2025  
**Reference**: WWW '25 Companion Proceedings, Pages 1635-1638  
**DOI**: https://doi.org/10.1145/3701716.3717810  
**Published**: 23 May 2025

This paper establishes the epistemic sovereignty principles and offline-first architecture that underpin Veritheia's design. The guardrail techniques and local processing requirements directly influence the system's use of local LLMs and rejection of cloud-first approaches.

### 3. Progress: A Post-AI Manifesto
**File**: [`2408.13775v1.pdf`](./2408.13775v1.pdf)  
**Authors**: Christoforus Yoga Haryanto  
**Year**: 2024  
**Reference**: arXiv:2408.13775 [cs.CY]  
**DOI**: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2408.13775  
**Note**: work-in-progress  
**Subjects**: Computers and Society (cs.CY); Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC)  
**Submitted**: 25 Aug 2024

This manifesto establishes Veritheia's foundational principle: AI systems must preserve human agency while amplifying intellectual capabilities. The emphasis on human-AI symbiosis directly informs Veritheia's design as an instrument that supports rather than replaces intellectual work.

### 4. Cognitive Silicon: An Architectural Blueprint for Post-Industrial Computing Systems
**File**: [`2504.16622v1.pdf`](./2504.16622v1.pdf)  
**Authors**: Christoforus Yoga Haryanto, Emily Lomempow  
**Year**: 2025  
**Reference**: arXiv:2504.16622 [cs.AI]  
**DOI**: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.16622  
**Note**: Working Paper, 37 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables  
**Subjects**: Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computers and Society (cs.CY)  
**Submitted**: 23 Apr 2025

This paper provides Veritheia's architectural vision: computing systems that embed moral coherence and preserve human identity through irreversible constraints. Veritheia implements these principles through journey-specific projection spaces where insights require three inseparable components—source materials, conceptual framework, and reasoning path. This architecture naturally incentivizes authentic knowledge transfer: copying outputs without the generative journey produces meaningless artifacts, ensuring intellectual sovereignty at the system level.

### 5. Contextualized AI for Cyber Defense: An Automated Survey Using LLMs
**File**: [`2409.13524v1.pdf`](./2409.13524v1.pdf)  
**Authors**: Christoforus Yoga Haryanto, Anne Maria Elvira, Trung Duc Nguyen, Minh Hieu Vu, Yoshiano Hartanto, Emily Lomempow, Arathi Arakala  
**Year**: 2024  
**Reference**: 2024 17th International Conference on Security of Information and Networks (SIN), 02-04 December 2024  
**DOI**: [10.1109/SIN63213.2024.10871242](https://doi.org/10.1109/SIN63213.2024.10871242)  
**Also**: arXiv:2409.13524v1 [cs.CR] - [https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2409.13524](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2409.13524)  
**Note**: 8 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables

This paper demonstrates two LLM-assisted literature survey methodologies that directly inform Veritheia's approach to document analysis. The paper's Method B (using Gemma 2:9b for screening and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for full-text analysis) provides the theoretical foundation for Veritheia's systematic screening process. The emphasis on contextualized AI—systems that utilize proprietary and domain-specific knowledge—aligns with Veritheia's journey-specific document projections.

## Relevance to Veritheia

These five papers establish the theoretical foundation for Veritheia's architecture as epistemic infrastructure for intellectual sovereignty.

**Post-AI Manifesto** and **Cognitive Silicon** provide the philosophical foundation: human-AI symbiosis that preserves agency while amplifying capability through systems that embed moral coherence via irreversible constraints. **EdgePrompt** establishes epistemic sovereignty through local-first processing and systematic cloud rejection. **LLAssist** demonstrates AI as measurement instrument within user frameworks rather than generic oracle. **Contextualized AI** reveals that AI achieves highest value within domain-specific, proprietary knowledge contexts.

Together, these papers resolve the fundamental tension in knowledge work: achieving scale without sacrificing authorship. Veritheia's architecture transforms these insights into operational reality—an environment where formation happens through authorship, understanding emerges through engagement, and insights remain irreducibly personal while supporting collaborative intellectual work.
