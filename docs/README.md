# Veritheia Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the complete documentation for Veritheiaâ€”an environment where you author your own understanding rather than consume processed information.

Start with the [VISION](./VISION.md) to understand how Veritheia ensures intellectual sovereignty.

## Documentation Standards

### Document Structure

Each document should include:

1. **Title** - Clear, descriptive title as H1
2. **Purpose Statement** - Brief paragraph explaining the document's intent
3. **Table of Contents** - For documents over 3 sections

### Formatting Conventions

- **Headings**: Use hierarchical markdown headings (H1 for title, H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections)
- **Code Examples**: Use fenced code blocks with language hints
- **Diagrams**: ASCII diagrams for architecture, Mermaid for complex flows
- **Lists**: Use numbered lists for sequences, bullet points for unordered items

### Cross-References

- Link between documents using relative paths: `[See Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md#section-name)`
- Maintain link integrity when renaming sections
- Use descriptive link text, not "click here"

### Language Guidelines

#### Requirement Levels (inspired by RFC 2119)

When documenting requirements, use these keywords consistently:

- **MUST/REQUIRED**: Absolute requirements
- **MUST NOT**: Absolute prohibitions  
- **SHOULD/RECOMMENDED**: Strong recommendations with valid exceptions
- **MAY/OPTIONAL**: Truly optional features

Example: "The Process Engine MUST validate all API requests"

#### Clarity Principles

- Write for developers who are new to the project
- Define domain terms on first use
- Prefer concrete examples over abstract descriptions
- Keep sentences concise and paragraphs focused

### Document Types

1. **Conceptual** (like ARCHITECTURE.md)
   - Focus on the "what" and "why"
   - Avoid implementation details
   - Use domain language

2. **Specification** (like MVP-SPECIFICATION.md)
   - Enumerate features and requirements
   - Use consistent formatting for easy scanning
   - Include acceptance criteria where applicable

3. **Technical** (like IMPLEMENTATION.md and EXTENSION-GUIDE.md)
   - Focus on the "how"
   - Include code examples
   - Reference specific technologies and versions

4. **Operational** (like planned DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md)
   - Step-by-step procedures
   - Prerequisites clearly stated
   - Troubleshooting sections

### Maintenance

- Review documents quarterly for accuracy
- Update cross-references when restructuring
- Archive deprecated documents with clear notices
- Track major changes in commit messages

## Contributing to Documentation
