# Veritheia Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the complete specification for Veritheiaâ€”a system where you develop your own understanding by engaging with documents through your questions and frameworks. Unlike AI tools that generate summaries or answers, Veritheia helps you build genuine comprehension at scale.

This repository provides the **open source foundation** for formation through authorship. Institutions, organizations, and research teams extend from this foundation for their specific collaborative and distributed needs.

**New to Veritheia?** Start with [01-VISION](./01-VISION.md) for the conceptual overview, or jump to [16-GLOSSARY](./16-GLOSSARY.md) if you encounter unfamiliar terms.

**Note**: The current implementation diverges from this specification. See [Development Progress](../development/PROGRESS.md) for details on the architectural refactoring needed to match the specification.

## Architectural Approach

**Composable Component Architecture**: Veritheia uses a composable architecture where components can be combined in different configurations:
- **ApiService**: Should be core business logic library (Application Programming Interface, not HTTP REST)
- **Web**: Should import ApiService directly for in-process communication
- **ApiGateway**: HTTP API component for external integration
- **McpGateway**: AI agent integration via Model Context Protocol

**Key Principles**:
- **User Agency**: Users remain the authors of their intellectual work
- **Data Sovereignty**: All formation data belongs exclusively to users
- **In-Process Communication**: Direct method calls eliminate network overhead
- **Formation Through Authorship**: Understanding develops through engagement, not consumption

## Reading Order

Documents are numbered to suggest a reading path:
- **For Users**: Start with [01-VISION](./01-VISION.md) to understand why Veritheia exists, then [02-USER-GUIDE](./02-USER-GUIDE.md) to see what it enables
- **For Developers**: Read [01-VISION](./01-VISION.md) through [05-FOUNDATION-SPECIFICATION](./05-FOUNDATION-SPECIFICATION.md) in order for complete context
- **For Contributors**: Review [15-DOCUMENTATION-GUIDE](./15-DOCUMENTATION-GUIDE.md) before making changes
