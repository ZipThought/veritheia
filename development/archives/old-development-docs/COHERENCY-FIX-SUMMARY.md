# PROGRESS.md Coherency Fix Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-11  
**Issue**: PROGRESS.md was incoherent with the new archived file structure

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated Warning Header
- Changed from "ARCHITECTURAL IMPERATIVE VIOLATION WARNING" 
- To "PROGRESS TRACKING NOTE" reflecting current reality
- Now correctly states that phases 2-11 are archived due to violations

### 2. Corrected Implementation Assessment
- **Was**: "AI successfully implemented ~85% of MVP"
- **Now**: "Actual implementation: ~20-30% functional"
- Added note about fundamental issues (wrong primary keys, mocking violations)

### 3. Fixed Phase Status Table
All phases updated to reflect reality:
- Phase 1: **Needs Rework** (wrong primary keys)
- Phases 2-7: **Archived** (built on flawed assumptions)
- Phases 8-10: **Needs Verification/Skeletal** (untested)
- Phases 11-12: **Not Started**

Changed documentation links to point to `/archives/` directory

### 4. Updated MVP Functionality Status
- Removed all checkmarks claiming completion
- Added warnings about violations
- Listed actual state: skeletal implementations, untested code

### 5. Fixed Individual Phase Sections
For each archived phase (2-7):
- Changed status from "Tested ✅" to "Archived ❌"
- Updated journey links to point to archives
- Replaced "COMPLETED" sections with "STATUS" showing violations
- Added references to archived locations

For phases 8-10:
- Changed from "Implemented ✅" to "Needs Verification ⚠️" or "Skeletal ⚠️"
- Replaced completion claims with reality checks
- Noted lack of testing

### 6. Added Decision Log Entries
- Documented decision to archive phases 2-11
- Noted composite primary key requirement
- Linked to ALIGNMENT-GAPS.md for action plan

## Impact

PROGRESS.md now accurately reflects:
- Most work is archived due to architectural violations
- Real completion is ~20-30%, not 85%
- Database schema needs fundamental rework
- Tests violate no-mocking imperatives
- Most "completed" work is skeletal and untested

## Next Steps

See [ALIGNMENT-GAPS.md](./ALIGNMENT-GAPS.md) for the PDCA action plan to fix:
1. Database schema (composite primary keys)
2. Test infrastructure (remove mocking)
3. Actual implementation of skeletal code
4. Journey projection spaces
