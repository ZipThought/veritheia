# Journey: [Phase Name]

This document chronicles the investigation and emergence of decisions. Each entry follows the 5W+1H investigation and dialectical testing. The truth emerges from examining tensions, not from following prescriptions.

## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM - [Title of Investigation]

### The 5W+1H Investigation

**What** is being decided?
- The specific technical choice or pattern under consideration
- The precise scope of what this affects

**Who** does this affect?
- Users: How does this shape their experience?
- Developers: What does this demand of future contributors?
- System: What components depend on this decision?

**When** does this matter?
- What triggers the need for this decision?
- When will its effects be felt?
- What temporal constraints bound it?

**Where** in the architecture?
- What layer does this belong to?
- What boundaries does it cross or respect?
- Where will the implementation live?

**Why** now?
- What problem does this solve?
- What happens if we don't decide this?
- Why can't this be deferred?

**How** will it be done?
- What are the concrete implementation steps?
- What tools or libraries are involved?
- How will we verify it works?

### The Dialectical Test

**Thesis**: [The proposed approach]
- State the proposal clearly
- Include its claimed benefits
- Note its acknowledged costs

**Antithesis**: [The strongest alternative or objection]
- Present the most compelling alternative
- Or the strongest reason not to do this
- Give it full voice, not a strawman

**Synthesis**: [What emerges from the tension]
- Sometimes the thesis proves stronger
- Sometimes the antithesis reveals a better way
- Sometimes a third option emerges
- Record what actually convinces, not what should

### Evidence Gathered

```bash
# Commands run to test assumptions
```

```csharp
// Code written to explore possibilities
```

- Links to documentation consulted
- Error messages that revealed constraints
- Performance measurements that shaped decisions

### Decision

State what was decided and why this particular synthesis emerged from the investigation.

### Implementation Notes

*Added as work proceeds*

- What actually happened when implementing
- Surprises encountered
- Adjustments made

## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM - [Next Investigation]

*The pattern continues for each significant decision point*

---

## Emerging Patterns

*Updated as patterns become visible*

Document patterns that emerge from multiple investigations:
- Recurring tensions that shape decisions
- Principles that prove themselves through application
- Constraints that repeatedly influence choices

## Questions for Future Phases

*Updated as dependencies become clear*

Questions this phase raises but cannot answer:
- Decisions deferred to phases with more context
- Assumptions that need validation
- Interfaces that need agreement
