# Phase 03 Journey: Repository Pattern

## The Investigation Begins

**2025-08-09 11:30 UTC** - Starting Phase 3 dialectical investigation for repository pattern implementation.

## Pre-Investigation Discovery

Looking back at Phase 1, it had "Repository pattern implementation (NOT STARTED)" in its CHECK section. This reveals an important distinction:
- Phase 1 needed **basic data access** to test if the database worked
- Phase 3 implements **domain repository pattern** with journey boundaries
- These are different abstraction layers of "repository"

This confusion is common in DDD - the word "repository" means different things at different layers.

## The Central Questions

1. How do we implement data access that respects journey-specific projections?
2. Should repositories know about journey boundaries or should that be enforced elsewhere?
3. How do we handle pgvector operations that EF Core doesn't fully support?

## 5W+1H Investigation

### WHAT is a repository in Veritheia's context?

**Initial Understanding**: A repository provides data access abstraction over the database.

**Deeper Question**: In a system where documents only have meaning through journey projections, what does "data access" mean?

**Thesis**: Repositories are simple CRUD wrappers over DbSets
- Just abstract EF Core operations
- Return IQueryable for flexibility
- Let services handle business logic

**Antithesis**: Repositories enforce journey boundaries
- Never return data outside current journey
- Embed journey context in every query
- Repository IS the boundary guardian

**Emerging Synthesis**: Repositories provide **journey-aware data access**
- Base repositories handle simple CRUD
- Journey-scoped repositories add boundary enforcement
- Services orchestrate cross-journey operations when allowed

### WHO uses repositories?

**Direct Users**:
- Services (Phase 6) - for business logic implementation
- Process Engine (Phase 5) - for process execution
- API Controllers (Phase 4) - NEVER directly (through services)

**Indirect Users**:
- UI (Phase 11) - through API calls
- Tests (Phase 12) - through mocking interfaces

**Critical Insight**: Repositories are not just for data access - they're the enforcement point for intellectual sovereignty. They ensure users only see projections from their own journeys.

### WHEN are repositories created vs used?

**Creation Time**:
- Registered in DI container at startup
- Scoped lifetime (per request)
- DbContext injected

**Usage Pattern**:
```csharp
// In a service
public async Task<JourneyFormation> RecordFormationAsync(Guid journeyId, string insight)
{
    // Repository ensures this journey belongs to current user
    var journey = await _journeyRepo.GetByIdAsync(journeyId);
    if (journey == null) throw new UnauthorizedException();
    
    // Create formation within journey bounds
    var formation = new JourneyFormation { ... };
    return await _formationRepo.AddAsync(formation);
}
```

### WHERE do repositories live?

**Thesis**: In veritheia.Data with entities
- Close to what they access
- Can use internal DbContext knowledge

**Antithesis**: In veritheia.Core as interfaces, implementations in Data
- Interfaces are contracts (core)
- Implementations are details (data)

**Synthesis**: 
- **Interfaces** in `veritheia.Core/Interfaces/Repositories/`
- **Implementations** in `veritheia.Data/Repositories/`
- This allows Core to define contracts without knowing about EF Core

### WHY do we need repositories when we have DbContext?

**Beyond Simple Abstraction**:

1. **Journey Boundary Enforcement**
   ```csharp
   // BAD: Direct DbContext access
   var segments = _context.JourneyDocumentSegments.Where(s => s.JourneyId == id);
   
   // GOOD: Repository enforces boundaries
   var segments = await _segmentRepo.GetByJourneyAsync(journeyId, userId);
   ```

2. **Vector Operations Abstraction**
   ```csharp
   // Repository hides pgvector complexity
   public async Task<List<JourneyDocumentSegment>> FindSimilarAsync(
       Guid journeyId, float[] embedding, float threshold)
   {
       // Raw SQL for vector similarity
       return await _context.JourneyDocumentSegments
           .FromSqlRaw(@"SELECT * FROM journey_document_segments s
                        JOIN search_indexes i ON s.id = i.segment_id
                        JOIN search_vectors_1536 v ON i.id = v.index_id
                        WHERE s.journey_id = {0}
                        AND v.embedding <=> {1} < {2}",
                        journeyId, embedding, threshold)
           .ToListAsync();
   }
   ```

3. **Testability**
   - Mock IRepository instead of DbContext
   - Simpler test setup
   - Clear boundaries

### HOW should repositories be structured?

**Pattern Discovery Through Dialectical Testing**:

#### Pattern 1: Generic Repository Only
```csharp
public interface IRepository<T> where T : BaseEntity
{
    Task<T?> GetByIdAsync(Guid id);
    Task<List<T>> GetAllAsync();
    Task<T> AddAsync(T entity);
    Task UpdateAsync(T entity);
    Task DeleteAsync(T entity);
}
```
**Problem**: No journey awareness, no vector operations

#### Pattern 2: Specific Repositories Only
```csharp
public interface IJourneyRepository
{
    Task<Journey?> GetByIdAsync(Guid id, Guid userId);
    Task<List<Journey>> GetUserJourneysAsync(Guid userId);
    // ... specific methods
}
```
**Problem**: Lots of duplication, no common interface

#### Pattern 3: Layered Approach (SYNTHESIS)
```csharp
// Base generic interface
public interface IRepository<T> where T : BaseEntity
{
    Task<T?> GetByIdAsync(Guid id);
    IQueryable<T> Query();
    Task<T> AddAsync(T entity);
    Task UpdateAsync(T entity);
    Task DeleteAsync(Guid id);
}

// Journey-aware base
public interface IJourneyScoped<T> where T : BaseEntity
{
    Task<T?> GetByIdAsync(Guid id, Guid journeyId);
    Task<List<T>> GetByJourneyAsync(Guid journeyId);
}

// Specific repository with both patterns
public interface IJourneyDocumentSegmentRepository : 
    IRepository<JourneyDocumentSegment>,
    IJourneyScoped<JourneyDocumentSegment>
{
    // Vector operations specific to segments
    Task<List<JourneyDocumentSegment>> FindSimilarAsync(
        Guid journeyId, float[] embedding, float threshold);
}
```

## Critical Discoveries

### 1. Journey Boundaries Are First-Class

Repositories MUST enforce journey boundaries. This isn't optional security - it's fundamental to the architecture where meaning exists only within journey projections.

### 2. Vector Operations Need Special Handling

EF Core can't generate vector similarity queries. Repositories must:
- Use FromSqlRaw for vector operations
- Abstract the complexity from services
- Handle different vector dimensions (1536, 768, 384)

### 3. Unit of Work Pattern

**Decision**: Use DbContext as implicit Unit of Work
- EF Core already implements this pattern
- Adding IUnitOfWork wrapper adds complexity without benefit
- Services can coordinate multiple repository operations in one transaction

### 4. Specification Pattern

**Decision**: Use simple LINQ predicates, not full Specification pattern
- Specification pattern is overengineering for MVP
- LINQ expressions are sufficient
- Can add specifications later if needed

## The Repository Architecture

Based on investigation, Phase 3 will implement:

```

## Decision Records

### Decision 1: Layered Repository Pattern
**Choice**: Generic base + journey-aware base + specific interfaces
**Rationale**: 
- Reduces duplication
- Enforces journey boundaries consistently
- Allows specific operations per entity type

### Decision 2: Interfaces in Core, Implementations in Data
**Choice**: Split interfaces and implementations
**Rationale**:
- Core defines contracts without EF Core dependency
- Data has EF Core specific implementations
- Enables testing through mocking

### Decision 3: DbContext as Unit of Work
**Choice**: No explicit IUnitOfWork wrapper
**Rationale**:
- DbContext already provides this
- Simpler for MVP
- Can add if needed later

### Decision 4: Raw SQL for Vector Operations
**Choice**: Use FromSqlRaw in repositories for pgvector
**Rationale**:
- EF Core doesn't support vector operations
- Repositories abstract this complexity
- Services don't need to know about SQL

## What This Enables

With repositories in place:
- Phase 4 can build APIs that use repositories through services
- Phase 5 Process Engine can persist executions
- Phase 6 Services have data access layer
- Testing becomes possible through mocking

## Alignment with DESIGN-PATTERNS.md

After investigation, I found that DESIGN-PATTERNS.md already specifies:
- `IJourneyAwareRepository<T>` interface that filters everything through journey context
- Specification pattern for complex queries
- Journey boundaries built into every repository method

This confirms our investigation findings - journey boundaries are NOT optional.

## Open Questions for Implementation

1. Should we have a separate IVectorSearchRepository?
2. How to handle pagination efficiently?
3. Should repositories return DTOs or entities? (Entities for repositories, DTOs for APIs)
4. How to handle includes/eager loading? (Specification pattern handles this)
5. How to reconcile generic IRepository<T> with IJourneyAwareRepository<T>?

These will be resolved during implementation.

## Critical Disambiguation Problem

**2025-08-09 11:45 UTC** - Human correctly identifies ambiguity issue.

### The Problem

We have conflicting patterns:
1. **Generic IRepository<T>** - Standard CRUD operations
2. **IJourneyAwareRepository<T>** - Everything filtered by journey
3. But some entities DON'T belong to journeys (User, ProcessDefinition)

### The Disambiguation Investigation

#### Which Entities Are Journey-Scoped?

**Journey-Scoped** (need journey context):
- JourneyDocumentSegment (segments exist within journeys)
- JourneyFormation (insights from journeys)
- JourneySegmentAssessment (assessments within journeys)
- Journal & JournalEntry (belong to journeys)

**User-Scoped** (need user context, not journey):
- Journey (user has many journeys)
- Persona (user has personas)
- ProcessCapability (user capabilities)

**System-Level** (no journey or user scope):
- User (the root entity)
- ProcessDefinition (system configuration)
- Document (exists independently, projected into journeys)
- KnowledgeScope (organizational structure)

#### The Naming Conflict

If we have:
- `IRepository<User>` for users
- `IJourneyAwareRepository<JourneyDocumentSegment>` for segments

But what about:
- Documents that exist globally but are projected into journeys?
- Journeys that belong to users but not to other journeys?

### Proposed Resolution: Three-Tier Repository Architecture

```csharp
// Tier 1: System-level repositories (no scoping)
public interface IRepository<T> where T : BaseEntity
{
    Task<T?> GetByIdAsync(Guid id);
    Task<IReadOnlyList<T>> GetAllAsync();
    Task<T> AddAsync(T entity);
    Task UpdateAsync(T entity);
    Task DeleteAsync(Guid id);
}

// Tier 2: User-scoped repositories
public interface IUserScopedRepository<T> where T : BaseEntity
{
    Task<T?> GetByIdAsync(Guid id, Guid userId);
    Task<IReadOnlyList<T>> GetByUserAsync(Guid userId);
    Task<bool> BelongsToUserAsync(Guid entityId, Guid userId);
}

// Tier 3: Journey-scoped repositories
public interface IJourneyScopedRepository<T> where T : BaseEntity
{
    Task<T?> GetByIdAsync(Guid id, Guid journeyId);
    Task<IReadOnlyList<T>> GetByJourneyAsync(Guid journeyId);
    Task<bool> BelongsToJourneyAsync(Guid entityId, Guid journeyId);
}
```

### Specific Repository Examples

```csharp
// User repository - system level only
public interface IUserRepository : IRepository<User>
{
    Task<User?> GetByEmailAsync(string email);
    Task<bool> ExistsAsync(string email);
}

// Journey repository - user-scoped
public interface IJourneyRepository : 
    IRepository<Journey>,
    IUserScopedRepository<Journey>
{
    Task<Journey?> GetActiveJourneyAsync(Guid userId, string processType);
}

// Document repository - system level with projection awareness
public interface IDocumentRepository : IRepository<Document>
{
    // Documents exist globally
    Task<Document?> GetByFilePathAsync(string path);
    
    // But can check journey projections
    Task<bool> HasProjectionInJourneyAsync(Guid documentId, Guid journeyId);
}

// Segment repository - journey-scoped with vector ops
public interface IJourneyDocumentSegmentRepository : 
    IRepository<JourneyDocumentSegment>,
    IJourneyScopedRepository<JourneyDocumentSegment>
{
    Task<List<JourneyDocumentSegment>> FindSimilarAsync(
        Guid journeyId, 
        float[] embedding, 
        float threshold);
}
```

### The Key Insight

**Not everything is journey-scoped!** The disambiguation comes from recognizing three distinct scoping levels:

1. **System**: Entities that exist independently (User, Document, ProcessDefinition)
2. **User**: Entities owned by users but not journeys (Journey, Persona)
3. **Journey**: Entities that only exist within journey projections

This prevents us from forcing journey context where it doesn't belong while still enforcing it where it's critical.

## Test Infrastructure Investigation

**2025-08-09 12:30 UTC** - Investigating how to properly test Phase 1 & 2 before proceeding.

### The Testing Challenge

Before implementing Phase 3 repositories, we need to verify Phase 1 (database) and Phase 2 (domain models) actually work. This requires a test infrastructure decision.

### Test Isolation Options Evaluated

#### Option 1: Transaction Rollback
```csharp
// Begin transaction → Run test → Rollback
```
**Problem**: Can't test vector operations or raw SQL in rolled-back transactions.

#### Option 2: Fresh Container Per Test
```csharp
// New PostgreSQL container for each test
```
**Problem**: Too slow (2-3 seconds per test), resource intensive.

#### Option 3: Respawn - Database Reset (CHOSEN)
```csharp
// Single container → Run test → Reset data (keep schema)
```
**Benefits**: 
- Fast (~50ms per reset)
- Tests real PostgreSQL features
- True isolation between tests
- Can test transactions

### Decision: Respawn Model

**Choice**: Use Respawn library with single PostgreSQL container
**Rationale**:
1. Journey projections need real PostgreSQL (vectors, JSONB)
2. Fast enough for rapid testing
3. True isolation without container overhead
4. Can test everything including raw SQL

### Test Structure Decision

**Choice**: Expand existing `veritheia.Tests` project
**Rationale**:
- Already exists with Aspire integration tests
- Single test project easier to manage
- Can organize by phase/layer internally

```
veritheia.Tests/
├── TestBase/
│   ├── DatabaseFixture.cs       # Shared container + Respawn
│   └── DatabaseTestBase.cs      # Base class for all DB tests
├── Phase1_Database/

│   ├── EnumSerializationTests.cs
│   └── ValueObjectTests.cs
└── Phase3_Repositories/
    └── (future)
```

### PostgreSQL-Only Decision

**Choice**: All tests use PostgreSQL, no in-memory database
**Rationale**:
- Most features require PostgreSQL anyway (vectors, JSONB, ranges)
- Eliminates false positives from in-memory differences
- Single mental model for testing
- Confidence that tests validate production behavior

## Review of Phases 1-2 Before Repository Implementation

**2025-08-10** - Before proceeding with Phase 3 implementation, conducting thorough review of what Phases 1-2 completed.

### Phase 1 - Database Infrastructure
- **Created**: 21 entity classes with journey projection architecture
- **Tested**: Schema with real PostgreSQL, FK constraints, vector storage
- **Discovered**: "Every Journey requires a Persona" through FK enforcement

### Phase 2 - Core Domain Models  
- **Created**: 7 enums, 5 value objects
- **Tested**: All value objects and enum serialization
- **Discovered**: Entities from Phase 1 ARE the domain models

### Critical Discoveries from Phase 1

#### Foreign Key Constraints as Truth Enforcers

The test findings reveal PostgreSQL isn't just storage—it's a **design verification system**. When the test tried to create a Journey without a Persona:

```sql
ERROR: insert or update on table "journeys" violates foreign key constraint 
"FK_journeys_personas_PersonaId"
```

This wasn't a bug—it was the database teaching us a business rule.

#### What Strong Typing Prevented

| Scenario | NoSQL/JS Would Allow | PostgreSQL+C# Enforced |
|----------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Journey without Persona | Silently accepts null | FK constraint violation |
| Wrong vector dimension | Runtime error later | Compile-time type error |
| Invalid enum value | Stores any string | Type system rejection |

#### Technical Discoveries

1. **pgvector requires Vector type wrapper**, not raw float arrays
2. **Dynamic JSON needs explicit opt-in** for Dictionary<string,object>
3. **Real PostgreSQL required**—no in-memory substitute for vector ops
4. **Respawn provides best test isolation** (50ms vs 2-3s per test)

### Critical Discoveries from Phase 2

#### Entities ARE the Domain Models

The journey revealed that entities from Phase 1 already serve as domain models. No need for parallel structure:

```
Domain Model = {
    Entities: Data structure (Phase 1)
    Value Objects: Complex types (Phase 2)
    Enums: Named states (Phase 2)
    Services: Business logic (future phases)
}
```

#### Value Objects Encode Philosophy

The value objects aren't just DTOs—they embody Veritheia's principles:

1. **FormationMarker**: Captures moments of understanding
2. **InquiryPattern**: Tracks HOW users think, not just WHAT
3. **JourneyContext**: Preserves narrative continuity
4. **PersonaContext**: Evolves with user patterns

#### The InputDefinition Elegance

Instead of simple configuration, discovered a fluent API:
```csharp
var definition = new InputDefinition()
    .AddTextArea("question", "Research question", required: true)
    .AddDropdown("method", "Method", new[] {"systematic", "narrative"});
```

This builder pattern is more elegant than documentation suggested.

### What Phase 3 Must Account For

From Phase 1 & 2 learnings:
1. **Repository must respect FK constraints**—don't try to bypass database rules
2. **Use real PostgreSQL in tests**—vector operations require it
3. **Trust the type system**—compilation errors reveal design gaps
4. **Entities ARE domain models**—repositories work with existing entities
5. **Value objects carry semantic weight**—respect their boundaries
6. **Journey-Persona relationship is mandatory**—always Include() persona

## Entity Scoping Analysis

**2025-08-10** - Analyzing entity scoping to determine correct repository boundaries.

### Discovery: Not All Entities Are Journey-Scoped

Initial assumption was everything needs journey context. This is WRONG. Different entities have different scoping:

### System-Level Entities (No scoping needed)
- **User**: Root entity, exists independently
- **ProcessDefinition**: System configuration
- **ProcessVersion**: System versioning

### User-Scoped Entities (Need user context)
- **Journey**: Users own journeys
- **Persona**: Users have personas
- **ProcessCapability**: User capabilities
- **Document**: Users upload documents (CRITICAL: needs UserId!)
- **KnowledgeScope**: User's organizational structure

### Journey-Scoped Entities (Need journey context)
- **JourneyDocumentSegment**: Projections within journeys
- **JourneyFormation**: Insights from journeys
- **Journal & JournalEntry**: Journey narratives
- **ProcessExecution & ProcessResult**: Journey-specific runs

## CRITICAL ISSUE: Document User-Scoping Missing

**2025-08-10** - HIGH SEVERITY finding during entity analysis.

### Current Implementation (INCORRECT)

Document entity has NO UserId:
```csharp
public class Document : BaseEntity
{
    public string FileName { get; set; }
    public string MimeType { get; set; }
    public string FilePath { get; set; }
    public long FileSize { get; set; }
    public DateTime UploadedAt { get; set; }
    public Guid? ScopeId { get; set; }  // Links to KnowledgeScope
    // NO UserId field!
}
```

### The Implications

Without UserId on documents:
1. **Security Risk**: Any user could access any document
2. **Legal Risk**: No ownership tracking for copyright
3. **Audit Problem**: Can't track who uploaded what
4. **Future Problem**: Can't implement sharing properly

### Required Fix

```csharp
public class Document : BaseEntity
{
    public Guid UserId { get; set; }  // REQUIRED
    public User User { get; set; }    // Navigation
    // ... rest of fields
}
```

This requires:
1. New migration to add UserId column
2. Update repository to enforce user scoping
3. Test user isolation

## MVP Architecture Analysis

**2025-08-10** - Analyzing MVP specification to understand scoping requirements.

### Key Discovery: "Single-User Desktop MVP"

From MVP-SPECIFICATION.md:
> "Desktop application, single-user focus"

This creates confusion:
- If single-user, why have User table?
- If single-user, why user-scoping?
- Is this local-first or cloud-first?

### Analysis of Possibilities

#### Possibility 1: True Single-User Local
- One user per installation
- No multi-user features
- User table for identity only

#### Possibility 2: Multi-User Ready
- Start single-user
- Prepared for multi-user
- User scoping from day one

#### Possibility 3: Cloud with Single User
- Cloud deployment
- One user account initially
- Multi-user infrastructure ready

### The Evidence

1. **User table exists** - suggests multi-user preparation
2. **Journey has UserId** - enforces user boundaries
3. **Persona per User** - user-specific patterns
4. **But Documents lack UserId** - inconsistent!

## Architecture Clarification Required

**2025-08-10** - SIGNAL: Architecture ambiguity blocking implementation.

### The Ambiguity

The system shows mixed signals:
- Database has User table (multi-user ready)
- Docs say "single-user desktop" (local only?)
- Journey has UserId (user boundaries)
- Document lacks UserId (system global?)

### Critical Questions

1. **Is this a desktop app or web app?**
   - Desktop: Local database, single user
   - Web: Shared database, multi-user

2. **If desktop, why User table?**
   - Future cloud sync?
   - Multi-profile support?
   - Just over-engineering?

3. **Should Documents have UserId?**
   - Yes if multi-user
   - Maybe if future sharing
   - No if truly single-user

### Options

**Option 1: True Single-User Desktop**
- Remove User table
- Remove UserId from Journey
- Simplify to single-user model

**Option 2: Desktop with Future Cloud**
- Keep User for identity
- Add UserId to Documents
- Prepare for future sync

**Option 3: Multi-User Web from Start**
- Full user scoping everywhere
- Complete isolation
- Ready for production

## Architecture Resolution: Desktop-First with Future Sharing

**2025-08-10** - After analysis, understanding emerges.

### The Desktop-First Model

Veritheia follows a desktop-first architecture:
- **Desktop application** - Runs locally, stores data locally
- **Single user per installation** - Each installation has one user's data
- **Optional future cloud sync** - Can sync to cloud, share with groups
- **Explicit sharing** - User controls what gets shared, when, with whom

### How This Applies to Veritheia

#### MVP Phase (Current)
- Desktop application, self-contained
- Single user per installation
- No sharing, everything private
- User table exists for identity and future features

#### Post-MVP Phase (Future)
- Cloud sync capability
- Explicit journey sharing
- Granular control
- Intellectual sovereignty preserved

### Current Implementation is PARTIALLY CORRECT

Documents without UserId makes sense for single-user desktop MVP. But this creates problems for future sharing. 

### Decision Needed

**Option A**: Keep documents without UserId (simpler now, migration later)
**Option B**: Add UserId now (complex now, clean future)

## Critical Requirement: Document Ownership Tracking

**2025-08-10** - CRITICAL: Even single-user MVP needs document ownership.

### Why Documents MUST Have UserId

Even in single-user desktop:

1. **Legal/Copyright**: Track who uploaded copyrighted material
2. **Future Migration**: Clean path to multi-user
3. **Audit Trail**: Know who uploaded what, when
4. **Sharing Attribution**: "Document shared by User X"

### Required Changes

```csharp
public class Document : BaseEntity
{
    public Guid UserId { get; set; }        // REQUIRED
    public User User { get; set; }          // Navigation
    // ... other fields
}
```

### Impact on Repository Pattern

Documents need user-scoped repository:
```csharp
public interface IDocumentRepository : 
    IRepository<Document>,
    IUserScopedRepository<Document>
{
    Task<Document?> GetByIdAsync(Guid id, Guid userId);
    Task<IReadOnlyList<Document>> GetByUserAsync(Guid userId);
}
```

This changes Phase 3 implementation significantly.

## Progressive Enhancement Journey

**2025-08-10** - Investigating progressive enhancement approach for Phase 3.

### The Question

Given the complexity discovered, should Phase 3 use progressive enhancement?

### Pass 1: Minimum Viable Repositories
- Basic CRUD operations
- Direct DbContext usage where possible
- Only abstract what's necessary

### Pass 2: Add Scoping
- User scoping for documents
- Journey scoping for segments
- Enforcement at repository level

### Pass 3: Advanced Features
- Specification pattern
- Vector search operations
- Complex queries

### Decision: Progressive Enhancement Approved

Will implement Phase 3 in passes:
1. **Basic repositories** - Get it working
2. **Add scoping** - Make it correct
3. **Add features** - Make it complete

## Architectural Decision: Three-Tier Repository Pattern

**2025-08-10** - Final architectural decision for Phase 3.

### The Decision

Implement three-tier repository architecture:

1. **System-Level Repositories** (IRepository<T>)
   - For User, ProcessDefinition
   - No scoping needed
   - Basic CRUD

2. **User-Scoped Repositories** (IUserScopedRepository<T>)
   - For Document, Journey, Persona
   - Filter by UserId
   - User isolation

3. **Journey-Scoped Repositories** (IJourneyScopedRepository<T>)
   - For JourneyDocumentSegment, JournalEntry
   - Filter by JourneyId
   - Journey projection enforcement

### Implementation Plan

1. Create interface hierarchy in Core
2. Implement base repositories in Data
3. Add specific repositories per entity
4. Test scoping enforcement
5. Add vector operations last

### Critical: Document Needs UserId

Before implementing, must:
1. Add UserId to Document entity
2. Create migration
3. Update seed data

## Implementation Begins

**2025-08-10** - Starting actual implementation based on investigation.

### Created Interface Hierarchy

Created in veritheia.Core/Interfaces/Repositories:
- IRepository<T> - Base CRUD
- IUserScopedRepository<T> - User filtering
- IJourneyScopedRepository<T> - Journey filtering
- Specific interfaces per entity

### Created Base Implementations

Created in veritheia.Data/Repositories:
- BaseRepository<T> - Generic CRUD
- Specific repositories implementing interfaces

### Added Document Ownership

Modified Document entity to include UserId as discovered critical requirement.

### Tests Created

Four tests passing:
1. User CRUD operations
2. Document user scoping
3. Journey user scoping
4. Segment journey scoping

## Critical Re-evaluation: Repository Pattern Necessity

**2025-08-10** - After completing initial Phase 3 implementation, human guidance revealed fundamental misunderstanding.

### The Anti-Pattern We Created

We implemented generic repositories (IRepository<T>) wrapping EF Core's DbSet<T>. This is the classic "repository over repository" anti-pattern because:
- EF Core DbContext IS a Unit of Work
- EF Core DbSet<T> IS a Repository
- We were abstracting an abstraction

### Dialectical Investigation: Do We Need Repositories?

#### Thesis: Repositories Abstract Data Access
Traditional view - repositories hide database specifics, enable testing, provide abstraction.

#### Antithesis: EF Core Already Provides Everything
- DbContext is Unit of Work
- DbSet<T> is Repository
- In-memory database for testing
- LINQ provides query abstraction

#### Synthesis: Domain-Shaped Contracts Where Needed

The key insight from human guidance: **"You only add a separate repository layer when you need a domain-shaped contract"**

### What Veritheia Actually Needs

**Use EF Core Directly For:**
- Basic CRUD operations
- Simple queries with includes
- User/Journey/Document management
- Standard database operations

**Domain-Shaped Contracts Only For:**
1. **Document File Storage** - Abstracts filesystem/S3 (not in PostgreSQL)
2. **Journey Formation Tracking** - Semantic awareness, not mechanical scoping
3. **Semantic Search Operations** - pgvector domain operations

### The PostgreSQL Revelation

Critical insight: **PostgreSQL IS the semantic enforcer, not C# abstractions**

- Foreign keys enforce aggregate boundaries perfectly
- CHECK constraints enforce value object invariants
- pgvector provides semantic search
- JSONB enables flexible schemas
- These aren't implementation details - they're core architecture

"Anemic" C# models aren't actually anemic - they're honest projections of database truth. The database constraints ARE the domain model.

### DDD Correctly Distributed

**Where DDD Actually Lives:**
- **Aggregate Boundaries** → PostgreSQL FKs
- **Value Objects** → PostgreSQL types & constraints
- **Entities** → PostgreSQL tables + EF projections
- **Domain Services** → C# services (complex logic)
- **Repositories** → ONLY for non-PostgreSQL resources

### What Phase 3 Should Have Been

Instead of generic repositories, we needed:
1. **Domain services** using EF directly
2. **IDocumentStorageRepository** for filesystem only
3. **AuthoredResult<T>** at service layer
4. **Let PostgreSQL be the enforcer**

### The Corrected Architecture

```csharp
// NO repository for PostgreSQL data
public class JourneyService  // Domain service, not repository
{
    private readonly VeritheiaDbContext _db;  // Use directly
    private readonly IDocumentStorageRepository _files;  // Only for files
    
    public async Task<AuthoredResult<Journey>> StartJourneyAsync(...)
    {
        // Direct EF usage, PostgreSQL enforces constraints
        var journey = new Journey { ... };
        _db.Journeys.Add(journey);
        await _db.SaveChangesAsync();
        return AuthoredResult<Journey>.Success(journey, journey.Id);
    }
}
```

### Key Learnings

1. **EF Core already provides Repository + Unit of Work patterns**
2. **Don't abstract PostgreSQL - it's foundational like C#**
3. **Repository pattern only for external resources (files, S3)**
4. **Domain-shaped contracts only where they add semantic value**
5. **Let PostgreSQL enforce the domain model through constraints**

### Current State

Phase 3 implemented generic repositories that should be removed. The correct approach:
- Remove IRepository<T> and implementations
- Keep only file storage repositories
- Use EF Core directly in services
- Implement AuthoredResult<T> at service layer
- Document this learning in ARCHITECTURAL-DIVERGENCES.md

## Final Understanding: EF Core IS the Repository

**2025-08-10** - The culmination of our journey.

### The Anti-Pattern Trap

We fell into the classic trap:
1. Learned "repository pattern" as best practice
2. Wrapped EF Core in repositories
3. Created abstraction over abstraction
4. Added no value, only complexity

### The Correct Mental Model

```
PostgreSQL → EF Core → Domain Services → Controllers
    ↑           ↑            ↑              ↑
 Storage    Repository    Business       HTTP
            + UoW          Logic
```

EF Core already provides:
- **DbContext** = Unit of Work
- **DbSet<T>** = Repository
- **LINQ** = Specification pattern
- **Include()** = Eager loading
- **AsNoTracking()** = Read optimization

### When to Add Repository

Only when you need:
1. **Domain-shaped contract** (not CRUD)
2. **External resource abstraction** (files, APIs)
3. **Complex domain operations** (beyond LINQ)

### Phase 3 Conclusion

The generic repositories we built are unnecessary. The correct implementation:
- Delete generic repository interfaces
- Delete repository implementations
- Create domain services using EF directly
- Add repositories ONLY for file storage
- Implement AuthoredResult at service layer

**SIGNAL**: Repository implementation needs fundamental refactor
**WAITING**: Human decision on how to proceed

## Phase 3 Reimplementation: Correct Approach

**2025-08-10** - After human guidance, implementing Phase 3 correctly.

### What Was Removed (Anti-patterns)
- All generic IRepository<T> interfaces
- All repository implementations wrapping DbSet
- All specification pattern abstractions
- IUnitOfWork wrapper

### What Was Created (Domain-Shaped Contracts)

#### 1. IDocumentStorageRepository
```csharp
public interface IDocumentStorageRepository
{
    Task<string> StoreDocumentAsync(Stream content, string fileName, string mimeType);
    Task<Stream> GetDocumentContentAsync(string storagePath);
    Task<bool> ExistsAsync(string storagePath);
    Task DeleteDocumentAsync(string storagePath);
    Task<DocumentStorageMetadata> GetMetadataAsync(string storagePath);
}
```
This is a TRUE repository - it abstracts external resources (filesystem/S3).

#### 2. IJourneyFormationRepository  
```csharp
public interface IJourneyFormationRepository
{
    Task RecordDocumentEncounterAsync(
        Guid journeyId, Guid documentId,
        string encounterContext,  // WHY was this accessed?
        string formationPurpose);  // WHAT understanding is being formed?
        
    Task<IReadOnlyList<FormativeDocument>> GetFormativeDocumentsAsync(
        Guid journeyId, DateTime since);
}
```
This provides SEMANTIC awareness (journey formation tracking), not mechanical scoping.

#### 3. AuthoredResult<T> Pattern
```csharp
public class AuthoredResult<T>
{
    public bool IsSuccess { get; }
    public T? Value { get; }
    public Guid JourneyId { get; }  // Every result tied to journey
    public IReadOnlyList<FormationNote> FormationNotes { get; }
}
```
Implemented at service layer, not repository layer.

### Domain Services Using EF Core Directly

Instead of repositories for PostgreSQL data, domain services use EF Core directly:
```csharp
public class JourneyService
{
    private readonly VeritheiaDbContext _context;  // Use directly
    private readonly IJourneyFormationRepository _formationRepo;  // Only for semantic ops
    
    public async Task<AuthoredResult<Journey>> StartJourneyAsync(...)
    {
        // Direct EF Core usage - PostgreSQL enforces constraints
        var journey = new Journey { ... };
        _context.Journeys.Add(journey);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
        return AuthoredResult<Journey>.Success(journey, journey.Id);
    }
}
```

### The Final Architecture

```
PostgreSQL (semantic enforcer via constraints)
    ↑
EF Core (DbContext = UoW, DbSet = Repository)
    ↑
Domain Services (business logic, AuthoredResult)
    ↑
Controllers (HTTP concerns)

+ Domain Repositories ONLY for:
  - External storage (files, S3)
  - Semantic operations (formation tracking)
```

### Key Learnings Embodied

1. **EF Core IS the repository pattern** - DbContext is UoW, DbSet<T> is repository
2. **PostgreSQL IS the domain model enforcer** - FKs, checks, constraints
3. **Repositories only for external resources** - Files, APIs, not PostgreSQL
4. **Domain-shaped contracts where semantic value exists** - Formation tracking
5. **Direct EF Core for standard operations** - No abstraction needed

### Phase 3 Status

**Completed correctly** with:
- Domain-shaped contracts for external resources and semantic operations
- AuthoredResult pattern for journey attribution  
- Domain services using EF Core directly
- No anti-pattern generic repositories

The implementation now correctly distributes DDD:
- Aggregate boundaries → PostgreSQL FKs
- Value objects → PostgreSQL constraints
- Entities → EF Core projections
- Domain logic → C# services
- External resources → Domain repositories
