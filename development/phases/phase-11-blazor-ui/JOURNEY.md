# Phase 11: Blazor UI Journey Investigation

**Date**: 2025-08-10
**Purpose**: Investigate UI patterns and approach for MVP interface
**Following**: PDCA cycle with journey-first development

## PLAN - Documentation Review

### What Documentation Exists
- MVP-SPECIFICATION.md Section III: Presentation Layer
- Requirement: Desktop web client using Blazor
- Features needed: Library management, process execution, search, scope management

### Key UI Requirements from MVP Spec

#### 3.1 Library Management
- Artifact upload (PDF and .txt)
- Library view with metadata and filters
- Artifact detail view
- Deletion capability

#### 3.2 Process Execution Interface  
- Process selection list
- Dynamic input forms based on process
- Execution monitoring
- Process-specific result display

#### 3.3 Search & Discovery
- Unified search bar
- Document viewer (PDF/text)
- Navigation between results

#### 3.4 Scope Management
- Tree view for hierarchy
- Bulk assignment
- Scope navigation

#### 3.5 User Contexts
- Process-based UI adaptation
- Assignment access control
- Result visibility control

## Dialectical Investigation

### THESIS: Server-Side Blazor (Blazor Server)

#### The Argument
- Simpler state management (server maintains state)
- Smaller download size (no WASM runtime)
- Direct database access without API layer
- Real-time updates via SignalR
- Better debugging experience

#### Evidence
- MVP is desktop application (latency not an issue)
- Single user (no scaling concerns)
- Need real-time process monitoring
- Complex state during process execution

### ANTITHESIS: Client-Side Blazor (Blazor WebAssembly)

#### The Counter-Argument
- True offline capability (no server connection needed)
- Better performance for interactive UI
- Can work with static file hosting
- Progressive Web App potential
- More responsive user experience

#### Evidence
- MVP emphasizes local sovereignty
- Desktop app should work offline
- Heavy client-side interactions (search, filtering)
- Future mobile companion needs PWA

### SYNTHESIS: Blazor Server for MVP, Architecture for WASM Migration

#### The Resolution
Use Blazor Server for MVP with clean architecture that enables future WASM migration.

#### Why This Works
1. **Faster MVP Development**: Server-side is simpler to implement
2. **Desktop Context**: SignalR connection reliable on localhost
3. **Clean Architecture**: Service layer abstraction enables migration
4. **Process Monitoring**: Real-time updates natural with SignalR
5. **Future Path**: Can migrate to WASM or Blazor Hybrid later

#### Architecture Decisions
- Components use interfaces, not direct database access
- Service layer handles all business logic
- ViewModels for component state
- Repository pattern already rejected (use services directly)

## Component Structure Investigation

### Core Layout Components

#### MainLayout.razor
- Navigation sidebar
- Header with user context
- Content area
- Status/notification area

#### Navigation Components
- ProcessList.razor (available processes)
- JourneyList.razor (active journeys)
- LibraryNav.razor (document library)
- ScopeTree.razor (scope hierarchy)

### Feature Components

#### Library Management
- DocumentUpload.razor
- DocumentList.razor
- DocumentDetail.razor
- DocumentViewer.razor

#### Process Execution
- ProcessSelector.razor
- ProcessInputForm.razor (dynamic based on process)
- ProcessMonitor.razor (execution progress)
- ProcessResults.razor (dynamic based on process)

#### Search
- SearchBar.razor
- SearchResults.razor
- SearchFilters.razor

#### Journey & Journal
- JourneyDetail.razor
- JournalEntry.razor
- JournalTimeline.razor

### Shared Components
- LoadingSpinner.razor
- ErrorBoundary.razor
- ConfirmDialog.razor
- NotificationToast.razor

## State Management Pattern

### Service-Based State
- Services maintain state (already in Data project)
- Components inject services
- No additional state management library needed
- SignalR handles real-time updates

### Component Communication
- Parent-child via parameters and callbacks
- Service events for cross-component updates
- Cascading parameters for global context

## UI Framework Decision

### THESIS: Build Custom Components

#### Argument
- Full control over appearance
- No external dependencies
- Lightweight
- Matches Veritheia's philosophy

### ANTITHESIS: Use Component Library

#### Counter-Argument  
- Faster development
- Professional appearance
- Accessibility built-in
- Well-tested components

### SYNTHESIS: MudBlazor for MVP

#### Resolution
Use MudBlazor for rapid MVP development with custom styling.

#### Why MudBlazor
1. **Material Design**: Clean, professional
2. **Comprehensive**: All components needed
3. **Blazor-native**: Built for Blazor
4. **Customizable**: Can override styles
5. **Active community**: Well-maintained

## Next Steps (DO Phase)

1. Create Blazor Server project
2. Add MudBlazor package
3. Set up layout structure
4. Implement navigation
5. Create first feature (Document Upload)
6. Test with actual API
7. Iterate through features

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: SignalR Connection Issues
**Mitigation**: Implement reconnection logic and offline detection

### Risk: Large File Uploads
**Mitigation**: Streaming upload with progress indication

### Risk: Complex Dynamic Forms
**Mitigation**: Use reflection and component generation

### Risk: Performance with Large Result Sets
**Mitigation**: Virtualization and pagination

## Success Criteria

- All MVP UI features implemented
- Responsive and intuitive interface
- Process execution works end-to-end
- Search and filtering functional
- Document upload and viewing works
- Journey navigation clear
