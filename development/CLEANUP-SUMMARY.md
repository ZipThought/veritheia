# Development Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-11  
**Purpose**: Remove confusion by archiving outdated documentation

## What Was Done

### 1. Updated ALIGNMENT-GAPS.md
- Added CRITICAL architectural violations found in database schema
- Corrected false claim that database is "100% functional" 
- Documented that primary keys violate partition imperatives
- Added specific code fixes required

### 2. Archived ALL Flawed Documentation
Moved to `/development/archives/`:

**Core Documents:**
- **ARCHITECTURAL-DIVERGENCES.md** - Misunderstood imperatives as "divergences"
- **CONTEXT-RECOVERY.md** - Referenced repository patterns

**ALL Phase Work After Phase 1:**
- **phase-02-domain-models/** - DDD investigation without clear rejection
- **phase-03-repository-pattern/** - Repository investigation (led to rejection)
- **phase-04-api-completion/** - Built on wrong primary keys
- **phase-04-through-10/** - Retroactive journey with violations
- **phase-05-process-engine-completion/** - References to internal mocking
- **phase-06-platform-services-completion/** - Assumes wrong schema
- **phase-07-user-journey-completion/** - Tests with mocking violations
- **phase-11-blazor-ui/** - Planning on flawed foundation
- **dialectical-review-phase-4-7/** - Review of broken implementations
- **epistemic-self-review/** - Self-review of violations

### 3. Updated References
- **PROGRESS.md** - Updated links to point to archives
- **README.md** - Added archives section, removed outdated references
- Created **archives/README.md** explaining why files were archived

## Why This Was Necessary

The archived documents contained:
- Repository pattern references (we reject repositories)
- DDD praxis implementations (we reject praxis, embrace ontology)
- Mocking of internal services (only external allowed)
- Primary key strategies that don't support user partitioning

## Current State

### Clean Active Documentation
Only TWO items remain in phases folder:
- **phase-00-template/** - Template for future phases
- **phase-01-database/** - Original investigation (legitimate thinking)

Everything else was archived because it was built on flawed assumptions:
- Wrong primary keys (no user partitioning)
- Repository pattern remnants
- Test mocking violations
- Skeleton implementations claimed as complete

### Critical Issues Documented
ALIGNMENT-GAPS.md now correctly identifies:
- Database schema violates partition imperatives (wrong primary keys)
- Tests use prohibited mocking (InMemory, Moq)
- Journey projection spaces not implemented
- Real completion: ~20-30% (not 85%)

## Next Steps

1. **FIX DATABASE SCHEMA** - Composite primary keys (UserId, Id)
2. **REMOVE TEST MOCKING** - Use real PostgreSQL with Respawn
3. **IMPLEMENT QUERY EXTENSIONS** - ForUser() partition enforcement
4. **CREATE IUserOwned INTERFACE** - Structural partition enforcement

## Impact

- New contributors won't be confused by outdated patterns
- Clear separation between historical investigation and current imperatives
- Honest assessment of what actually works vs what's broken
- Archived files preserved for historical integrity
