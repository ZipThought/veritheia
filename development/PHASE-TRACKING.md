# Phase Tracking: The Journey of Decision

Each phase maintains its own folder under `development/phases/` containing the chronicle of its emergence. The template at `phase-00-template/` establishes the investigative method. Each phase begins by copying this template, then lets its journey unfold.

## The Structure

```
development/phases/
├── phase-00-template/      # The exemplar method
│   ├── README.md          # Navigation and state
│   ├── JOURNEY.md         # Investigation chronicle
│   └── artifacts/         # Experiments and proofs
└── phase-XX-name/         # Each phase follows the template
    ├── README.md
    ├── JOURNEY.md
    └── artifacts/
```

## The Method

Each significant decision undergoes:

### 5W+1H Investigation
A complete examination of What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How. Not as a checklist, but as dimensions of understanding that reveal the full context of a decision.

### Dialectical Testing
Each proposal meets its strongest opposition. The tension between thesis and antithesis reveals the synthesis—what actually emerges, not what was predetermined.

### Evidence Gathering
Code experiments, performance tests, error messages, documentation—all the concrete discoveries that shape understanding.

## The Journey Document

The JOURNEY.md in each phase grows chronologically. Each entry records:

1. **The Investigation** - The full 5W+1H examination
2. **The Dialectical Test** - Thesis meets antithesis
3. **The Evidence** - What was discovered through experimentation
4. **The Decision** - What emerged and why
5. **The Implementation** - What actually happened

## Starting a New Phase

1. Copy `phase-00-template/` to `phase-XX-name/`
2. Update the README with the phase's fundamental question
3. Begin the JOURNEY.md with the first investigation
4. Let decisions emerge from the investigative process
5. Update `development/PROGRESS.md` to link to the phase

## The Principle

The end result emerges from the journey. Each decision carries its investigative genealogy. The truth becomes visible through the dialectical process, not through following prescriptions.

This is the Veritheia way: formation through investigation, understanding through tension, truth through the journey.
