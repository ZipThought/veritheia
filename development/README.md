# Development Tools and Tracking

This folder contains all development-specific tools, scripts, and tracking documents for the Veritheia implementation.

## üö® CRITICAL: READ FIRST üö®

### Documentation Alignment Complete (2025-08-17)

The `/docs` folder has undergone comprehensive alignment to emphasize **formation through authorship** and the **neurosymbolic transcended architecture** as our key differentiator. All documents now coherently explain how users author symbolic systems in natural language that govern document processing.

**Key Changes:**
- Added Formation Notes connecting technical details to user sovereignty
- Created comprehensive glossary explaining neurosymbolic transcended architecture
- Removed repository patterns in favor of direct DbContext usage
- Replaced academic jargon with accessible language
- Fixed unenforceable "guarantees" language

**PENDING TASK**: Ensure development direction aligns with the updated specification. The implementation must follow the spec as documented in `/docs`, not exceed or diverge from it.

### Previous Alignment Gaps

**[ALIGNMENT-GAPS.md](./ALIGNMENT-GAPS.md)** - Contains previous epistemic scan findings showing discrepancies between documented claims and actual implementation status.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Previous Finding**: Implementation was ~40-50% complete, not the claimed 85%. Test infrastructure broken. Journey projection spaces not implemented. **These gaps need reassessment against the updated specification.**

## Contents

### Core Workflow
- **DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md** - MANDATORY workflow: Human ‚Üí Journey ‚Üí Docs ‚Üí Code

### Progress Tracking
- **PROGRESS.md** - Main implementation tracker with PDCA cycles for all 12 phases
- **PDCA-WORKFLOW.md** - Detailed workflow guide for Plan-Do-Check-Act methodology
- **ALIGNMENT-GAPS.md** - CRITICAL architectural violations and fixes needed

### Implementation Planning
- **IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md** - One-page summary of implementation plan

### Archives
- **archives/** - Historical documents with outdated patterns (DO NOT FOLLOW)

### Scripts
- **check-progress.sh** - Automated progress checker script

## Quick Start

After a context switch:
```bash
cd development
./check-progress.sh
# Then read docs/README.md for documentation index
cat IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md
```

## Usage

1. **Track Progress**: Update PROGRESS.md as you complete work
2. **Check Status**: Run `./check-progress.sh` for quick overview
3. **Recover Context**: Read CONTEXT-RECOVERY.md when resuming work
4. **Follow PDCA**: Use PDCA-WORKFLOW.md for quality implementation

## Important Rules

- Always read complete files (no partial reads)
- Update PROGRESS.md before context switches
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Keep source files < 500 lines, docs < 1000 lines
