# Veritheia Implementation Progress Tracker

This document tracks implementation progress using PDCA cycles. Each phase has clear checkpoints that survive context switches.

## üö® EPISTEMIC REVIEW: What Actually Happened vs What Was Claimed

**Revealed Truth**: The dialectical journey process was abandoned after Phase 3, leading to overclaiming and eventual correction.

### Timeline of Epistemic Breakdown and Recovery

1. **Phases 1-3**: Proper process with dialectical journeys ‚úÖ
2. **Phases 4-7 Initial Sprint**: Skeletons claimed as "complete" ‚ùå
3. **Documentation Overclaim** (commit 42e4bdf): False completion claims ‚ùå
4. **User Correction Demanded**: "Be honest about skeleton vs functional" ‚úÖ
5. **Real Implementation** (commit b30f320): Actual LLM integration and processes ‚úÖ

### Root Cause: Skipped Dialectical Journey
- No investigation of trade-offs ‚Üí accumulated debt
- No evidence gathering ‚Üí unverified claims  
- No decision documentation ‚Üí lost context
- Pressure to show progress ‚Üí epistemic breakdown

### The Lesson
The dialectical journey is not optional bureaucracy - it's the mechanism that maintains truth in technical work. Without it, "progress" becomes fiction.

## üö® HONEST CURRENT STATE (2025-08-10) - POST-CORRECTION

### What ACTUALLY Works (Verified with Tests)
- ‚úÖ **Database Layer (Phase 1-2)**: Fully functional, 36 unit tests passing
- ‚úÖ **Architectural Decision (Phase 3)**: Post-DDD approach documented and solid  
- ‚úÖ **APIs (Phase 4)**: 8 integration tests, all major endpoints verified
- ‚úÖ **Process Engine (Phase 5)**: 8 tests validating registration, execution, state
- ‚úÖ **Platform Services (Phase 6)**: 13 tests for extraction, embedding, storage
- ‚úÖ **User & Journey System (Phase 7)**: 13 tests for user, journey, persona, journal
- ‚úÖ **Cognitive Adapter (Phase 8)**: LocalLLMAdapter working with LM Studio
- ‚úÖ **Analytical Processes (Phase 9-10)**: Two processes implemented and tested

### What's MISSING
- ‚ùå **UI (Phase 11)**: Not started
- ‚ùå **End-to-End Tests (Phase 12)**: Have unit + integration, need E2E

### Honest Completion: ~85% Functional with Tests, ~15% UI Missing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Phases 1 & 2 Need Basic Testing Before Phase 3

**Discovery from Phase 3 investigation**: We conflated "basic data access" with "Repository Pattern", leaving Phases 1 & 2 untested. Before proceeding to Phase 3's domain repositories, we need:
- **Phase 1**: Basic CRUD to verify database accepts data
- **Phase 2**: Simple tests that enums and value objects work
- This is NOT the full Repository Pattern (Phase 3) - just basic verification

## Important: These 12 Phases Build the MVP

All 12 phases below work together to deliver the MVP specified in [MVP-SPECIFICATION.md](../docs/MVP-SPECIFICATION.md). The MVP is the complete product with two reference processes (Systematic Screening and Constrained Composition). These phases are the implementation steps to build that product:

- **Phase 1**: Data foundation that enables journey projections
- **Phases 2-4**: Core infrastructure (models, repositories, APIs)  
- **Phases 5-8**: Process engine and cognitive capabilities
- **Phases 9-10**: The two MVP reference processes
- **Phase 11**: User interface
- **Phase 12**: Testing and documentation

Without all 12 phases, the MVP cannot function. Phase 1's database schema supports ~70% of MVP features but requires the remaining phases for runtime functionality.

## Phase Investigation Structure

When a phase requires investigation (per [DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md](./DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md)), create a journey under `development/phases/`:

```
development/phases/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ phase-01-database/      # Example: Database investigation
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Phase overview and status
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ JOURNEY.md         # Investigation chronicle
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ artifacts/         # Code experiments, proofs
```

### Journey Investigation Method

For significant technical decisions, use the dialectical method:

1. **5W+1H Investigation**: Examine What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How
2. **Dialectical Testing**: Present thesis vs antithesis to reveal synthesis
3. **Evidence Gathering**: Code experiments, benchmarks, error discoveries
4. **Decision Recording**: What emerged from investigation and why
5. **Implementation Notes**: What actually happened vs what was planned

The Phase 1 Database journey demonstrates this method in practice. Not all phases need investigation - conventional patterns and minor decisions can proceed directly to implementation.

## PDCA Workflow for Each Phase

Following [DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md](./DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md), each phase embodies the PDCA cycle with documentation BEFORE implementation:

### PLAN - Documentation First
1. **Read Documentation**: Review all relevant specs for the phase
2. **Signal Gaps**: If docs are unclear or missing, STOP and signal
3. **Confirm Understanding**: Ensure specs match current architecture
4. **Define Deliverables**: List specific, verifiable outputs

### DO - Implementation with Awareness
1. **Follow Specifications**: Implement exactly what's documented
2. **Signal Discoveries**: When finding undocumented code or issues
3. **Document Decisions**: Record any deviations or choices made
4. **Mark TODOs**: Explicitly track temporary solutions

### CHECK - Verification Against Specs
1. **Test Against Documentation**: Does implementation match specs?
2. **Run Automated Tests**: Unit, integration, and relevant tests
3. **Manual Verification**: Confirm expected behaviors work
4. **Code Review**: Ensure patterns and conventions are followed

### ACT - Learning and Adjustment
1. **Update Documentation**: If reality differs from specs, update docs
2. **Record Learnings**: What worked, what didn't, what surprised
3. **Identify Dependencies**: What this enables for next phases
4. **Propagate Changes**: If specs changed, update related docs

**Started**: 2025-08-09
**Completed**: 2025-08-10 (with test findings)
**Journey**: [Phase 1 Journey Investigation](./phases/phase-01-database/JOURNEY.md)
**Docs**: [ENTITY-RELATIONSHIP.md](../docs/ENTITY-RELATIONSHIP.md), [IMPLEMENTATION.md#data-architecture](../docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md#data-architecture)

- [x] Review journey investigation for UUIDv7 decision
- [x] Review ENTITY-RELATIONSHIP.md for journey projection tables
- [x] Review IMPLEMENTATION.md for polymorphic vector storage
- [x] Confirm all specifications are current

#### DO (Implementation)

- [x] Apply migration to create 21 tables in database

#### DO (Implementation Notes)
- PostgreSQL 17.5 running on port 57233 (Docker container managed by Aspire)
- pgvector 0.8.0 extension installed and verified
- Fixed case-sensitivity issues in check constraints (PostgreSQL quoted identifiers)
- Fixed Docker image tag: pgvector/pgvector:pg17 (not 17-pg17)
- .NET 9 SDK issue resolved via symlink (/usr/share/dotnet/sdk ‚Üí /usr/lib/dotnet/sdk)

#### CHECK (Verification)

- [x] HNSW indexes created successfully (3 indexes verified)
- [x] 21 tables created in database
- [x] Data persistence configured (.WithDataVolume in AppHost)
- [x] Connection available via .NET Aspire orchestration

#### ACT (Learnings & Handoff to Next Phases)
- **Learning**: Journey projection architecture successfully translated to relational + vector schema
- **Learning**: UUIDv7 via .NET 9 provides temporal ordering without custom implementation
- **Learning**: HNSW indexing configured for multi-dimensional vector search (1536, 768, 384)
- **Dependency**: Phase 2 (Core Domain Models) needed before any data operations
- **Dependency**: Phase 3 (Repository Pattern) needed to test data access
- **Note**: DesignTimeDbContextFactory has hardcoded connection for migrations only
- **Note**: Runtime connection provided by .NET Aspire orchestration

#### IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION: Repository Layers
- **What Phase 1 needed**: Basic data access layer for testing (simple CRUD)
- **What Phase 3 delivers**: Domain repository pattern (journey-aware boundaries)
- **Key insight**: "Repository" has multiple abstraction layers:
  - Layer 1: Basic data access (could test DB works)
  - Layer 2: Domain repositories (business rules)
  - Layer 3: Application services (orchestration)
- **For future context**: Phase 1 deferred testing because we conflated basic data access with full Repository Pattern

### Phase 2: Core Domain Models
**Status**: Tested ‚úÖ
**Started**: 2025-08-09
**Completed**: 2025-08-10 (with test findings)
**Journey**: [Phase 2 Journey Investigation](./phases/phase-02-domain-models/JOURNEY.md)
**Docs**: [CLASS-MODEL.md](../docs/CLASS-MODEL.md), [ENTITY-RELATIONSHIP.md](../docs/ENTITY-RELATIONSHIP.md)

- [x] Confirm ProcessContext can carry journey information ‚úÖ
- [x] Validate InputDefinition fluent API works ‚úÖ
- [x] Ensure Core<->Data project references work properly ‚úÖ

#### KEY DISCOVERIES
- üîç Entities from Phase 1 ARE the domain models
- üîç InquiryPattern tracks HOW users think
- üîç InputDefinition uses elegant builder pattern
- üîç Value objects encode philosophical boundaries

#### PLAN (Documentation Review)
- [x] Review CLASS-MODEL.md for domain requirements
- [x] Review ENTITY-RELATIONSHIP.md and Phase 1 implementation
- [x] Conduct dialectical investigation
- **Discovery**: Phase 1 entities ARE the domain models

#### DO (Implementation)
- [x] Entities already created in Phase 1 (21 entity classes)
- [x] Created 7 domain enums (JourneyState, ProcessState, etc.)
- [x] Created 5 value objects (ProcessContext, JourneyContext, etc.)
- [x] Added Core project reference to Data project
- [x] Project builds successfully

#### CHECK (Verification)
- [x] Domain entities match Phase 1 journey projection implementation
- [x] All enums created (7 total) matching specifications
- [x] All value objects created (5 total) for transient data
- [x] No business logic in entities (correct separation)
- [x] Project builds with Core<->Data reference

#### ACT (Learnings & Handoff)
- **Learning**: Entities as domain models appropriate for MVP
- **Learning**: Journey investigation revealed Phase 1 already created domain models
- **Discovery**: CLASS-MODEL.md outdated - shows ProcessedContent instead of JourneyDocumentSegment
- **Dependency**: Phase 3 (Repository Pattern) can now use these models
- **Note**: Entities use strings for enums to match database (e.g., State = "Active")


---

### Phase 3: First Principles Data Access (Formerly Repository Pattern)
**Status**: Architecturally Pivoted ‚úÖ
**Started**: 2025-08-09
**Pivoted**: 2025-08-11 - Explicit rejection of DDD
**Journey**: [Phase 3 Journey Investigation](./phases/phase-03-repository-pattern/JOURNEY.md)
**Docs**: [DESIGN-PATTERNS.md](../docs/DESIGN-PATTERNS.md) - Completely rewritten

#### ARCHITECTURAL PIVOT
- **Discovery**: DDD patterns conflict with PostgreSQL/EF Core natural patterns
- **Decision**: Explicitly reject DDD in favor of first principles engineering
- **Rationale**: DDD requires translation layers between incompatible paradigms

#### WHAT WAS REJECTED
- ~~IRepository<T> generic interface~~ ‚Üí Use EF Core DbContext directly
- ~~ISpecification<T> pattern~~ ‚Üí Use LINQ expressions directly
- ~~Repository implementations~~ ‚Üí Services use DbContext directly
- ~~IUnitOfWork wrapper~~ ‚Üí DbContext already IS Unit of Work
- ~~Aggregate roots with behavior~~ ‚Üí PostgreSQL FKs enforce aggregates
- ~~Domain objects with logic~~ ‚Üí Intelligence lives in LLMs

#### WHAT REMAINS
- **FileStorageService**: For filesystem/S3 (external to PostgreSQL)
- **ICognitiveAdapter**: For AI services (external, varied providers)
- **Direct EF Core usage**: Services use DbContext without abstraction
- **PostgreSQL constraints**: Database enforces all domain rules
- **Simple entities**: Honest projections of database truth

#### DOCUMENTATION UPDATES
- **DESIGN-PATTERNS.md**: Completely rewritten with first principles patterns
- **Philosophical foundation**: Explains why DDD conflicts with our stack
- **Clear examples**: Shows direct EF Core usage vs repository abstractions

#### NEXT STEPS
- Phase 4 can use services with direct DbContext access
- No repository abstractions to maintain
- Simpler, more direct code throughout

## Context Recovery Checklist

When resuming work after context switch:

0. **RTFM FIRST**: Start with `docs/README.md` and READ THE DOCS
1. **Read Current Phase**: Check which phase is "In Progress"
2. **Review DO Section**: See what was already implemented
3. **Check Git**: `git status` and `git log -5 --oneline`
4. **Run Tests**: Verify current state with test suite
5. **Database State**: Check migrations with `dotnet ef migrations list`
6. **Continue PDCA**: Resume at CHECK or ACT as appropriate

**NEVER SKIP STEP 0!**

## CRITICAL: File Reading Rules

**MANDATORY**: Always read files in their entirety. NEVER use partial reads.

If a file is too large to read completely:
1. Document it as technical debt
2. Plan refactoring to split the file
3. Maximum sizes:
   - Source files (.cs): 500 lines
   - Documentation (.md): 1000 lines

## Decision Log

Major decisions that affect multiple phases:

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| - | Use JSONB for ProcessResult.Data | Flexibility for extensions | Affects process implementations |
| - | pgvector for embeddings | Native PostgreSQL solution | Affects search implementation |

**For architectural divergences from core documentation**, see [ARCHITECTURAL-DIVERGENCES.md](./ARCHITECTURAL-DIVERGENCES.md)

This maintains Single Source of Truth (SSOT) - all divergences are documented in one place.
