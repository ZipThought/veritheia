# Veritheia Implementation Progress Tracker

This document tracks implementation progress using PDCA cycles. Each phase has clear checkpoints that survive context switches.

## Progress Tracking Format

Each phase follows this structure:
```
### Phase X: [Name]
**Status**: Not Started | In Progress | Completed | Blocked
**Started**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Completed**: YYYY-MM-DD

#### PLAN
- [ ] Specific deliverable 1
- [ ] Specific deliverable 2

#### DO (Implementation Notes)
- Note: What was actually implemented
- Decision: Key decisions made
- Change: Deviations from plan
- TODO: List any temporary solutions or incomplete work

#### CHECK (Verification)
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual verification complete
- [ ] Code review complete

#### ACT (Next Steps)
- Learning: What we learned
- Improvement: What to change
- Dependency: What this enables
```

## Context Recovery Checklist

When resuming work after context switch:

0. **RTFM FIRST**: Start with `docs/README.md` and READ THE DOCS
1. **Read Current Phase**: Check which phase is "In Progress"
2. **Review DO Section**: See what was already implemented
3. **Check Git**: `git status` and `git log -5 --oneline`
4. **Run Tests**: Verify current state with test suite
5. **Database State**: Check migrations with `dotnet ef migrations list`
6. **Continue PDCA**: Resume at CHECK or ACT as appropriate

**NEVER SKIP STEP 0!**

## CRITICAL: File Reading Rules

**MANDATORY**: Always read files in their entirety. NEVER use partial reads.

If a file is too large to read completely:
1. Document it as technical debt
2. Plan refactoring to split the file
3. Maximum sizes:
   - Source files (.cs): 500 lines
   - Documentation (.md): 1000 lines

## Decision Log

Major decisions that affect multiple phases:

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| - | Use JSONB for ProcessResult.Data | Flexibility for extensions | Affects process implementations |
| - | pgvector for embeddings | Native PostgreSQL solution | Affects search implementation |
